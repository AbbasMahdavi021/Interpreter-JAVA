# CSC 413 - Project Two - The Interpreter

This project is an interpreter for a simplified version of a programming language called Mock Language X. The interpreter works in tandem with a Virtual Machine to execute programs written in Mock Language X.


## Features

Processes byte codes generated from Mock Language X source code files (with the extension ".x")
Provides a runtime environment through the Virtual Machine for executing programs
Includes sample programs for computing Fibonacci numbers and factorials

Sample Programs
Two sample programs, a recursive Fibonacci computation and factorial calculation, are included as ".x.cod" files. You can use them as references or test cases for your own Mock Language X programs.

Please refer to each project's respective directory and the documentation directory for more details on their implementation, usage instructions, and any additional documentation.
